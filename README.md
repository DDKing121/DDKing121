Hi, I'm Nongki Derick — a digital marketing expert, web designer, and consultant with over 5 years of experience helping brands across Africa grow and thrive. I specialize in creating strategic digital marketing plans, with a focus on content marketing, social media, and paid advertising to build trust and drive sales.

I’m a CPD-certified consultant and work with the Tadita Group Digital Agency, where I lead efforts to expand our digital services in Cameroon. I also have a strong background in web design, helping businesses establish a compelling online presence.

I've spoken at the African Digital Conference on topics like content marketing, target market research, and sales strategies. Previously, I worked as a Digital Marketing Specialist at SPARK Afrik and served as Chief Marketing Officer at the African Inclusive Institute of Public Speaking.
